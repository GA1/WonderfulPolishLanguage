# Wonderful Polish Language

## Preamble (Wstęp - Preambuła)

Hello, I am [Dominik](https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominik) 'Domcio' (The diminutive of the name Dominik) [Karol](https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karol) [[Wolfgang]](https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfgang) (From the [Catholic Sacrament Of Confirmation](https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bierzmowanie), so it doesn't really count, but it is still worth to mention this powerful name) [Rajchel](https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polskie_nazwiska) and  I am currently 18 years old. I go to IT school. I have created for you this wonderful list - document of resources for learning - getting more experience with Polish language - I mainly dedicate it to foreigners who are looking for [re]sources to learn the Polish language , but also to my compatriots and aliens [and parrots] and not only for beginners or advanced people, this list is also useful for natives who are looking for new sources of education and entertainment in their language. I think this [**POWERFUL**] Polish is a really great language. Thanks to its flexibility you can create great compositions - poems etc. That's why I would like to really help promote it. Personally, I am constantly expanding the number of known words, because it is a very useful thing in my life. I learn English from the first grade of elementary school ([Szkoła podstawowa](https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Szko%C5%82a_podstawowa)) and German from the first grade of middle school ([Gimnazjum](https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gimnazjum)), but I give less priority to German because it would only be useful for me to read [Grimms' Fairy Tales in the original language](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grimms_M%C3%A4rchen). At home I learn mainly Japanese. In the future I am also going to learn other Slavic languages a bit more. The order of the links is mostly random. I add clean links, without any extra and referral code in URLs. Currently I'm focusing on adding free and legal sources or those that also offer free legal content. Maybe in the future I'll also add categories with paid (also legal xD) websites. I hope that the first version of my list is satisfactory, I wanted to publish it in a sensible form. If you know any other good [free :D] websites related to Polish, feel free to let me know when a website has stopped distributing content in an fair way, please report it to me, also in case the website end its activity or changes the URL or project name or the page I added is "really uncool". I can often joke about some things, but please do not take anything personally, because I do not do this to offend someone, I just want to add variety to some content. Have fun with this language. 

*Łubudubu, łubudubu, niech żyje nam ten projekt jednoosobowego klubu, niech żyje nam! To śpiewałem ja - Domcio.* 

Pozdrawiam bardzo serdecznie.

## Contents (Spis treści)

(I offered the [hamsters](https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chomiki) that destroyed the cables from the teleports to cooperate in searching for bugs in the text code. After that I repaired the teleport connections, so in this version all should work)

It is such an interesting thing, for people who want to learn dialects (Sometimes they are very funny, because the sometimes words used in them are vulgar in the common use - common language).
  - [Polish magazines published in Polish (You can also choose other languages in the filters, I set up Polish for this)](https://polona.pl/search/?filters=language:polski,category:serials,public:1,hasTextContent:0) - A public mine of historical information, you can read here a lot of articles from the pre-war period and more.

This is a direct link to download the latest version (as of 22.09.2020). If you want to start your adventure with the world of programming and you don't know which language to choose for the start, I personally recommend Python, because you can start this adventure in a very simple and quite relaxed way, but it is also worth trying to get to know other languages later, to have a kind of contrast and to be sure if this choice was really good, you can also know many programming languages and a lot of people do, but it is worth knowing one very well first, because then it is easier with others ([Here is the official tutorial page in Polish](https://www.learnpython.org/pl/)).

As the authors write, there are millions of entries with tracks in the index, after entering a word that interests us,the search engine tries to find a video on YouTube (based on subtitles) in which it is used.

- [Gwara więzienna](https://pl.wiktionary.org/wiki/Indeks:Polski_-_Gwara_wi%C4%99zienna) - A set of words used in prison colloquial speech.

### Pingwin Mroźny

[Pingwin Mroźny (Penguin Frosty)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdhssPbvaKk&list=PL2yH5_nRkFqwAI-ulb6y8j-AfOiMKGLCN&index=2) - This is a character created by me ([Pingwin](https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pingwin_kr%C3%B3lewski) - first name and [Mroźny](https://pl.wiktionary.org/wiki/mro%C5%BAny) - surname). The mascot of my main channel and artistic activity. I created a whole [Universe](https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wszech%C5%9Bwiat) around him. Each "typical" episode is intended to introduce the viewer to some kind of profession (the core of the Penguin's movements themselves refers to the film [Wonsz żeczny (humorous record of correct form "wąż rzeczny")](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVPj0phGjyU), which is still present in Poland or was present in the old times - "extinct professions" and sometimes there were references to historical characters, I also invented some of my own professions. Here is [guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HyAuXibszs), in which I described "how to get to know this universe so as not to get lost in it", i.e. I presented the chronology, because I created a lot of films, as well as a [short] [computer game](https://gamejolt.com/games/pingwinmroznypoczatek/343963) and [also] a [short story](https://www.wattpad.com/594393714), so the viewer could get lost in my universe without it. A lot of people will ask "Why?", at that time my head was like a locomotive from which the steam flew all the time, so I wanted to find my way to "express myself artistically" and eventually I did it in this form, but I tried very hard, so these are not the kind of films you would think if you look at them out of context. I also started to promote this kind of "pseudo-animation", which I personally called "dead animation". In other film forms, a revolution began to take place, just like in Antic Theater - more [voice] actors (synthesizer voices) began to arrive. I am most pleased with the series ["Przygody Pingwinbada Żeglarza"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUnP-kDL284&list=PL2yH5_nRkFqxtW04-v-yDyB7QUD__oAmn) (The name refers to:  ["Przygody Sindbada Żeglarza" by Bolesław Leśmian]([https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Przygody_Sindbada_%C5%BBeglarza](https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Przygody_Sindbada_Żeglarza)) and it's wordplay) ["Pingwinia Komedia"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUnP-kDL284&list=PL2yH5_nRkFqxtW04-v-yDyB7QUD__oAmn) (The name refers to: ["Boska Komedia"](https://wolnelektury.pl/katalog/lektura/boska-komedia/) - Polish translation of ["Divine Comedy"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divine_Comedy) by Dante Alighieri). and from [the first episode of the "Danse Pingvinabre"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O15T5evhnQk) (The name refers to the medieval [Danse Macabre](https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taniec_%C5%9Bmierci)) series. I wanted to include this long description (and I created a separate subcategory) in this list as "the main reward of my work", because I want to leave some remembrance and awareness in people to remember my works and also to open the door to potential cooperation and job. 

### YouTube

(I like to add those channels that do not have exaggerate with the absurdity of thumbnails and titles - [clickbaits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clickbait). I want to make it as easy as possible to retrieve information from the videos on this site without wasting your time on "one million [fillers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filler_(media))" included in today's **typical** YouTube videos focused on massive marketing). Of course, it is not always possible to "escape" from this, so sometimes people who want to reach a larger audience want to adapt to the "standards of popularization of content" in this way.

- [Course of Polish](https://www.youtube.com/user/Jareczny) - There are a lot of "words of the day" here, and then the speaker shows the sentences in which these words can be used - context.
- [Polish Alphabet and Pronunciation in English](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFg4xVJCR77RsydiBI9YVCYAw2Uc55Y-q) - a complete course in English on Polish alphabet and pronunciation
- [Polish Alphabet and Pronunciation in Spanish](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFg4xVJCR77RwrLKbdYhkLYfYXF0WOHv4) - a complete course in Spanish on Polish alphabet and pronunciation
- [SAY IT IN POLISH](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCDOVLmcmVWGit5vTgS2Q6Q) - Nice channel about "saying it" (some more complex message) in Polish. And not only that, it is also worthwhile to look through older videos.

The channel might be useful for people from Japan who would like to learn Polish and more, because "Ignacy" was a free listener in Polish studies at the Uniwersytet Śląski in Katowice, as he himself wrote in the description of the channel. He explains very interesting issues, refutes myths and stereotypes related to Japan or Japanese, which people spread unconsciously in Poland (and not only here).  
- [Skazany na film](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8ROk73ZAWnDk6VS5kXTzVQ) - A great channel about film, where the author describes things from this world in a very inspiring way.

- [Klocuch](https://www.youtube.com/user/KlocuchRecenzje) - [Mr. Cuch's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sS3xkUyqyUQ) YouTube channel. This is one of the legends of Polish YouTube, which shares its opinions on various topics in a very unconventional way, and you should not take things that he says personally, because all these words are said in a joke or some philosophical aspect (he often refers to things related to the childhood of many Poles). I also add it here because he speaks a very diverse language - he uses words from many dialects and loan words (a lot of German origin).
- [Historia bez cenzury](https://www.youtube.com/user/HistoriaBezCenzuryMB) - The historical channel, where the main anchorman - Wojciech Drewniak presents history in a cool, eccentric and humorous way. There is also an [English version](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCd51P-3L-OiG-L4NH36ArAA/videos), but after three films this project has been stopped.
- [Niklaus Pieron](https://www.youtube.com/NiklausPieron) - The channel of Mikołaj, who often talks about things related to the Silesian language and culture (On the subject of the [ślůnsko godka]([https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etnolekt_%C5%9Bl%C4%85ski](https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etnolekt_śląski)), I recommend listening to the Silesian version of ["Grosza daj Wieźminowi" - "Toss A Coin To Your Witcher"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcQfjH6PFUE)).

He talks about them by adding more of his colorful metaphors and opinions, so he simply talks about the plot in an unconventional and accessible way, so it helps many people to remember the course of these books, which is often useful on all school's "smaller" and "main" exams (I personally am neutral to this, but I add this channel objectively, because I know that many people like it for different reasons). He also reviews films in a similar way and tries his hand at cooking based on popular recipes.

## Audio

- [My playlist with "The best of Polish music creations"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCw3rMng0nw&list=PL2yH5_nRkFqwxh63njdnt3emJ0rq0f2fp) - I have created a playlist of songs that are memorable, also a part of the Polish culture, often many jokes - references to them. I update it from time to time as soon as I have a "marathon of listening to music". So that's the playlist of "core songs of Poland" (But there's not much Disco Polo here anyway, I keep it to a minimum because it's still a subjective playlist, and I'm already bored with this genre and I think then that it's mostly "homogenous"). I'm also interested in Polish music from different times, so you'll find some older songs there, I'm also trying to add the best quality version to the playlist, and not thrown by a third party in very poor and even more compressed quality.
- [Lista przebojów TOP 30](https://kinopolskamuzyka.pl/top-30)  - TOP 30 of Polish music hits by Kino Polska Muzyka. The vote is repeated every week, so the ranking is often refreshed (Many Polish hits are so good that they always appear on the rankings, so it's usually just about a place on the list).

- [WIDZĘ GŁOSY](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsS2pcVBbDAdn8pPoh0mUkQ) - A channel where the most famous Polish voice actors are interviewed. Often you can learn from them many interesting stories from the realization of a given project and observations of the actors themselves. Often the actors sing songs that they have sung in a polish versions of movies productions. Of course, these are usually songs from the old days, so you can observe the voice changes of such people.
- [Live Act](https://www.youtube.com/user/heksmaestro) - One of the best Polish sources of knowledge about music production and theory. There are a few podcasts, which are a mine of knowledge for [not only new] music producers. Piotrek - the creator of the channel, he also touched upon psychological issues related to the creation of music, such as how to deal with creative blockades and [which DAW is "the best for start"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wtjCr-zp2g) (I personally recommend [FL Studio](https://www.image-line.com) to start with or [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org) or [MuseScore](https://musescore.org/pl/download) and [LMMS](https://lmms.io/download)). So if you want to learn more about music (techniques, many cool tricks, world of producers and schemes and free plugins - VSTs etc.), then I really recommend it.
- [Polskie Podcasty](http://polskiepodcasty.pl/wszystkie-podcasty) - A catalog of polish podcasts.
- [Katalog Biblioteki Polskiej](http://katalog.bibliotekapiosenki.pl/) - A catalog of polish songs.
- [Filharmonia Narodowa](https://www.youtube.com/user/FilharmoniaNarodowa) and [this](http://filharmonia.pl) - official website of the Polish National Philharmonic and its YouTube channel. You can find there a lot of great symphonic concerts and much more.
- [Polskie Nagrania](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCeAFhL7tQmtLp9zk7uQpNoQ) - official channel of the Polish record company ["Polskie Nagrania"](https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polskie_Nagrania_%E2%80%9EMuza%E2%80%9D).

- [Real Polish](https://realpolish.pl/podcast) and [Here is the official Archive.org profile with free podcasts, because some of them require a VIP account, and here you have free podcasts right away](https://archive.org/details/@realpolish)

There are usually several versions available in one archive file, i.e. versions with extra settings and the original version without any additional settings.

### Song lyrics, notes and tabs (Teksty piosenek, nuty i taby)

- [Tekstowo](https://www.tekstowo.pl) - one of the currently most popular Polish websites offering lyrics to songs. Transcriptions are created by users. You will need it if you want to learn a language by listening to songs, because you will be able, for example, to listen and read at the same time or you can try to write down what you heard and then check the lyrics of the song to see if it is correct, it is certainly a nice method and quite mind friendly and not boring in my opinion. 
- [Groove](https://www.groove.pl) - Another option, there are a lot of song interpretations and, of course, the subtitles themselves, so this will come in handy if we want to understand the deeper meaning of the tracks. Sometimes you have to do some research anyway to find out what song had the true message, especially in case of old Polish songs, like those from the 80s. If you haven't found the meaning of a song, write to me, then I'll try to help you interpret it by helping you know the history of those times and knowing the people who lived then, because I'm from 2001, so hehehe. but I still have a lot of knowledge on this issue, and I also got to know a part of the biographies of the local music artists, which can be useful in this regard.
- [Teksty](https://teksty.org) - service very similar to the above. It has a slightly more old-school look.

- [Forum Harmoszka (Archive version)](http://web.archive.org/web/20200224194456/https://www.forum.harmoszka.com/) - A very cool forum with tabs for the harmonica. I, for example, used this forum to learn how to play ["Hejnał mariacki"](https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hejna%C5%82_mariacki). I gave a link to the archive version of the forum, because it did not work for me personally, maybe some technical work is in progress. As far as the choice of instrument to play is concerned, I recommend the piano [keyboard] (king of instruments), but if you want something even simpler and very mobile, the harmonica and kazoo (a totally easy to play instrument) will also be cool.

The voices of the characters are from very popular voice actors, and documentary films about these actors have been made as part of the project, so it is worth watching them on [the project's official YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzZPtg45BJjKpxSB2ER1mxw). Another big project worth mentioning is the still being created mod ["Myrtana Chronicles"](https://www.youtube.com/KronikiMyrtany) (A lot of great Gothic mods have been created for many years, so when they come out, there will be a lot of them to play).

## Services (Serwisy)

- [Duolingo](https://www.duolingo.com) - Practically everyone knows this wonderful service, which mascot is a green bird named Duo (just be careful and do regular lessons so he doesn't get upset, it's very important, don't forget about your course, hehe). A Polish language course for English speakers is supported there (US, but people who know the UK version and others will understand as well). I have rewritten every English language course out of curiosity, but I mainly learn Japanese and Czech there ([My profile](https://www.duolingo.com/profile/TheDomcio) and If you want me to give me Duolingo Plus for free - every real registration is an + 7 days for free, if i good remember, in this case you can register from [this link](https://invite.duolingo.com/BDHTZTB5CWWKSTFKMXIFBF4Q7Y). The plus version removes ads from the site, and on the mobile version it allows you to download courses and do lessons offline [and more](https://support.duolingo.com/hc/pl/articles/115004068043-Czym-jest-Duolingo-Plus-). But I will honestly say that for now I have a break and I don't use the service now, but "I'll be back!", so it's mainly good for you, if you want to have me in your follows after registration, of course you can follow me also if you already have account). I used to be in the top league in the ranking, but now I've fallen by the lack of activity. 
- [Quizlet](https://quizlet.com/subject/polish) - something like [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net), but online and much more, so it's worth checking it out.
- [Quzizz](https://quizizz.com/admin/search/J%C4%99zyk%20polski) - A page with quizzes. There are a lot of quizzes created by teachers for their [mostly youngs[ students, so it's a good option to repeat different things for example from the basics of grammar and so on.

## Culinary (Kulinaria)

There are over 140 books by famous authors (in those days). They are mostly written in a language very similar to today's, and often also include words less commonly used today (but not archaisms), a lot of interesting recipes can be found there and of course you can download it all for free and probably without any major limits (maybe there is a limit, but with an attempt to download a huge amount). If you have a large amount of potatoes, it will probably be worthwhile to check the recipes from the book "200 potraw z ziemniaków" [(200 dishes from potatoes)](https://polona.pl/item/200-potraw-z-ziemniakow,MjAyNDY4NzU). Such a number of dishes should make you not be hungry for a long time.

Witam w mojej kuchni" and also from showing how to recreate a very well-known product at home, e.g. fries from a well-known fast food restaurant etc.  then it is worth to check out his older videos.
- [Uwaga Babcia Gotuje](https://www.youtube.com/user/vezyr1) - YouTube channel, where the titular grandmother cooks. In Poland the so-called "grandma cuisine" is very respected.

- [IleWazy.pl](http://www.ilewazy.pl) -  A large base of products and their calorific value, fat, protein, etc. There is no need to be paranoid, but if you exercise, for example, it is worth knowing how much any food contains protein.
- [Czytamy Etykiety](https://czytamyetykiety.pl) - website with analysis of food labels. There are also food rankings, so if you live in Poland (and not only because there are a lot of products in Poland, which are also abroad, it sometimes happens that the composition is different, of course), and you try to eat valuable and relatively healthy food, it may come in handy. Of course, there are also descriptions of the ingredients from which food is made, e.g. [here is about high-fructose corn syrup](https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syrop_glukozowo-fruktozowy).

### Recipes for holidays and festivities (Przepisy na święta i uroczystości)

- These are the main ones, in some regions of Poland may appear additional. Very useful if you want to learn the names of the most important Polish holidays and festivities. Calendar for [2020](https://www.kalendarzswiat.pl/swieta/2020) and [2021](https://www.kalendarzswiat.pl/swieta/2021). [Polish holiday and  festivities names in English](https://www.ingless.pl/artykul/nazwy-swiat-w-jezyku-angielskim).

  - [Shrove Tuesday](https://www.przepisy.pl/przepisy/okazje/tlusty-czwartek) - It is definitely worth trying Polish pączki (filled with rose marmalade) and faworki (chrust). I like to eat a lot of French fries this day (Because literally it means "Fat Thursday" in Poland). Often people bring pączki to work and school and share them with others, in general, it is all about eating as much fat food as possible, it may be a slightly unhealthy holiday - "The largest cheat meal day in the year" xD. 

  - [Valentine's Day](https://www.mojegotowanie.pl/przepis/kruche-ciasteczka-walentynkowe) - (The same can happen in the days of a girl[friend] and a boy[friend])On the occasion of that day, people give themselves handmade cakes, self-made cards or anonymous letters (in some schools, students go with such a box, where you can anonymously throw a letter to someone and then it is delivered to the addressee, it is such a way of secretly professing your feelings. At least it was possible in my early youth - a few years ago xD). I personally consider this holiday to be purely commercial ("holidays" of this kind can turn true feelings into a "product"), I think that if you really love someone, you can more often do such "private Valentine's Day", but I already think that doing something like that by yourself is more valuable than spending large sums of money on some mascots, which can also be a lovely gift, but would be even greater if there was an attempt to sew them yourself. This also increases the inner emptiness of loneliness of some people when they see an idealized image of couples buying each other's gifts, and some forget that they can also give gifts to their best friends or family on that day, because love is not only reserved for humans in very close relationships - in the end, it all comes down to spending time together, so just enjoy the moments with those you have at that moment, and don't regret the lack of moments with people you don't have at that moment (I know these are such truistic words and this is a heavy and complex subject).

  - [Easter](https://kuchnialidla.pl/przepisy/wielkanoc) - (In Poland it is not customary to invite ostriches for Easter, it is the ostriches themselves who have to ask for the invitation, vampires do the same). [This holiday is recognized as the most important Christian holiday (Not bad explanation)](https://www.sochaczew.pl/home/newsshow2/1383?title=Dlaczego-Wielkanoc-jest-wazniejsza-od-Bozego-Narodzenia). I like winter, but this holiday is more fun for me because I like eating armoracia rusticana (I look forward to the moment when I can try the true and fresh wasabi).It is also believed in some regions that at that time, ["Zajączek"](https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zaj%C4%85c_wielkanocny) brings gifts, just like ["Święty Mikołaj"](https://123tlumacz.pl/swiety-mikolaj-czy-santa-claus-prawdziwa-historia) on the Christmas time ([Main Polish Easter Traditions](https://polskidlaobcokrajowcow.blogspot.com/2015/03/polskie-tradycje-wielkanocne.html) and [this is very useful also](https://ellalanguage.com/blog/wielkanoc-po-angielsku/)). This holiday may be a bit terrible for vegans, but here, too, it is mainly about symbolism - metaphors, so you can simply prepare alternative dishes and spend the time in the same way, because it is not really about food, which is often mentioned in this category. Religious (and not just them) people go to church in the morning with a basket ([about święconka](https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%9Awi%C4%99conka)) of food to be consecrated by the priest. On the occasion of Easter in Poland, eggs are decorated to make ["pisanki"](https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pisanka). (When it comes to such preparation of ornamental things, this holiday contains a lot of this, because seven days before Easter, that is, on [Palm Sunday](https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niedziela_Palmowa), the so-called [Easter Palms](https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palma_wielkanocna), there are often competitions for which palm is the largest).

    [Here](https://polona.pl/item/ciasta-wielkanocne,NzI1MzgwNDY) is a nice book about Easter cakes by Mrs. Elżbieta Kiewnarska.

  - [Christmas](https://www.przepisy.pl/przepisy/okazje/wigilia-i-swieta) - During [this period](https://eszkola.pl/jezyk-angielski/swieta-bozego-narodzenia-po-angielsku-4536.html), personally, I like to eat the [łazanki z makiem](https://www.zajadam.pl/boze-narodzenie/lazanki-z-makiem-i-bakaliami) very much. A lot of carols are also sung. It is a religious holiday, like most people, but it is worth being aware that it is a part of Polish culture and it is not only reserved for Catholics and Christmas Eve can be attended by anyone. A lot of carols are also sung  ([Here you have an excellent list](https://pl.wikibooks.org/wiki/Kol%C4%99dy/Wszystkie_pie%C5%9Bni_na_Bo%C5%BCe_Narodzenie)). It is a religious holiday, like most other holidays in Poland, but it is worth being aware that it is part of Polish culture and it is not only reserved for Catholics and Christmas Eve can be attended by anyone, traditions are important for this country and the organizers are open to other nice people. It is mainly about family and friendly atmosphere, so you might as well spend time with your friends eating something good, not necessarily traditional food, but it would be great if you could. It is important to wait for the first star and many people go to a special night mass which is called [Pasterka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pasterka).

  - [New Year's Eve](https://nietylkopasta.pl/przepisy-na-sylwestra) - During this period, you usually invite your friends home or you come to their house. You eat a lot of fast food/snacks, watch different movies together, play board games like [Eurobusiness](https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurobusiness), remember past years, plan things for the future. When the clock points 0:00, children drink non-alcoholic champagne (I also drink it because I like to be sober and not try to flood problems with alcohol) and adults often forget about their limits - It's often just divided into groups that older people with their friends, children with their friends, it's probably also common to spend the new year only with the whole family, but I think it's nice to spend this time with best friends too. 

(There is also a [pumpkin holiday](https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halloween) that is celebrated in the USA and some people want to celebrate in Poland, but it is really rated very 50/50 in Poland, some people think it's nothing bad - just fun, other Poles think that this holiday does not fit into our Polish - Slavic culture and has been forcibly brought from abroad for commercial purposes, I personally don't mind this holiday, but I also think that the latter opinion is really reasonable and it's just "some kind of event" and those who play it shouldn't require the Poles to take part in it too. The day after 31 is quite a sad day, that is [All Saints' Day](https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uroczysto%C5%9B%C4%87_Wszystkich_%C5%9Awi%C4%99tych) for us such a Halloween once was an event called ["Dziady"](https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dziady_(zwyczaj)) ([Here you can read more about it](https://culture.pl/en/article/the-polish-halloween-all-you-need-to-know-about-dziady)).

### Agregators (Agregatory)

- [Wykop](https://www.wykop.pl) - The largest Polish news aggregator. The male user in the local dialect is called "Mirek" and the female "Mirabelka". You can choose to browse the homepage and also choose the tags you are interested in or create your own. You can also add tag data to the blacklist so that these do not appear on your homepage. The community is very diverse. I like the blood donation action under the name "Baryłka Krwi" (Barrel of Blood) and it is under the tag [#barylkakrwi](https://www.wykop.pl/tag/barylkakrwi).

## Social networks (Sieci społecznościowe)

- [/r/learnpolish](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpolish) - Very nice subreddit about learning Polish. If you have any questions, doubts or interesting information about things related to the Polish language, feel free to write there. Poland is generally a nation willing to help others, there is a huge hospitality culture here since the beginning of the country, so for over 1000 years. In every society, there are stupid, silly and fanatic people, and Poland is no exception, so we should not generalize, because we have a lot of intelligent, nice and tolerant people here. Poland often lost out on such an attitude, because for other countries, as it be in Politics, only interests mattered.

This site can be very useful to you, for example if you once lived in Poland and attended a Polish school, and you've really liked a lot of people and forgotten their names, there's a chance that you'll find some pictures and details of these people there (These are also worth mentioning: [Gadu-Gadu](https://gadu-gadu.pl) or [Grono.net](https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grono.net) - which lost its popularity when popularity of NK grew).
- [Przygody Reksia](https://discord.gg/aGRYDnP) - Discord server for fans of brilliant games from the "Reksio" series by Aidem Media (Yes, it's the same cartoon Reksio). The community is very friendly. You can also find here solutions to pass these games, but you will probably want to look at them to see how well you deduced the solution, not to see how to pass the whole game, right? The [Wiki](https://przygodyreksia.fandom.com/wiki/Strona_g%C5%82%C3%B3wna) is also worth checking.
- [Świta Domcia](https://discord.gg/aHthmme) - My own Discord Server which I created over 3 years ago. It is full of me because it is dedicated to my works. It's nicely developed, pretty quiet and comfortable. Friendly with descriptions for people from abroad.

## My nice tips (Moje świetne wskazówki)

- In Polish, there is such a thing that some sentences can be shortened. For example, instead of saying: "Jesteś mądry" [masculinum -y] or "Jesteś mądra" [in femininum **"a"** instead of **"y"**] (You are smart), you can tell: "Mądry**ś**"  or "Mądra**ś**" (Yes, -**ś** from jeste**ś**) or "Jesteś odważny" or "Jesteś odważna" (You are brave) = "Odważny**ś**" or "Odważna**ś**" or "Jesteś miły" or "Jesteś miła" (You are nice) = "Miły**ś**" or "Miła**ś**". If you want to become a knight or lady, it may come in handy to you, because it sounds a bit archaic, but I always remember that it's a cool thing, so I created this category to share such cool things with you.
- The word ["spoko"](https://pl.wiktionary.org/wiki/spoko) (comes from the word: "**spoko**jnie" - calmly) is a very useful and universal word. You can use it instead of "Nie ma za co" (You're welcome) and also "Nie ma problemu" (No problem), so when, for example, a neighbor apologizes to you that a his piano fell out of his window into your garden, you can tell him: "Spoko". You can say that you like something, e.g. "Ten film jest spoko" ("This movie is cool"). It is from many years a very popular word, so even the older ones will understand. Of course, it can be used to, for example, soothe someone nervous - "Spoko, wszystko będzie w porządku" (Chill, everything will be fine). Or you can confirm something with this word e.g. someone asks you if you want to go to the cinema, then if you want to, you say "Spoko" ("Yes" in this case). So, if you are afraid to use the word "w porządku" and you still use ["**ok**ay/okey(/okej)"](https://pl.wiktionary.org/wiki/OK), then "spoko" can be a cool alternative for you. Of course it's a slang word, so if you use it during a "serious conversation", someone might get the impression that you're a "relaxed kind of human", although that's good, because at least they will know you're an honest man.
- If you want to sound more like noble or just poetic (elevated/high style of speech), for example you can change the words (pronouns) "moim" (moje) to "mym" (me) and "twoim" (twoje) to "twym" (twe) [and more](https://pl.wiktionary.org/wiki/Aneks:J%C4%99zyk_polski_-_zaimki#m%C3%B3j,_tw%C3%B3j,_sw%C3%B3j) (Also check [here](https://sjp.pwn.pl/poradnia/haslo/Me-twe-swe;18579.html) and [HIER](https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mowa_(retoryka)#Mowa_w_stylu_wysokim)). So if you're wearing daily a monocle and a cylinder, it's something **absolutely necessary** for you, don't forget also to take your own tea set [and also you should have a large stock of [[matricaria chamomilla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matricaria_chamomilla) in your inventory] with a gilded cup (In general, this can sound a bit old-fashioned, but it's one of the cool ways to ["color"](https://pl.wiktionary.org/wiki/ubarwianie) your speech in Polish - sometimes one snowman from a certain cartoon talked in this style, so if you've watched this cartoon about a helpful green dragon, you'll know who was it).
- If you want to call (define) a person who likes something with a simple noun, you can do so by adding the ending (yes, yes - sufiks) **-olub** (or -**olubka** in femininum). For example a person who likes pasta = makaron**olub** or, for example, a person who likes locomotives = lokomotyw**olub** and yet a person who likes images = "obraz**olub**". It is a bit "synthetic" and may sound funny, so use it rather for such "chill conversations", than implement it in your everyday language, because, there are already [more "professional"] dictionary terms for people who like something like "audio**fil**" (audio**phile**) and its synonym: melo**man** (music lover and the suffix **-man** itself, that is from the word ["mania"](https://pl.wiktionary.org/wiki/mania), so it means a person who has a [mania](https://pl.wiktionary.org/wiki/mania) at some point, so a person who's maniacally eating broccoli ([brokuł - Brassica oleracea L. var. italica Plenck]([https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broku%C5%82](https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brokuł))) is "brokuło**man**" or "brokuło**maniak**" with [**-maniak**](https://pl.wiktionary.org/wiki/maniak)). I would just add that you can also do the same with the ending [**-fil**](https://pl.wiktionary.org/wiki/-fil), but there are also a lot of words to describe people with very bad tendencies (with various disorders) and you know what I mean. That is why the creation of words with this ending would be badly associated with some bad things. By the way, I would also like to take this opportunity to say that if, for example, we would like to define a human-like creatures, then we can do it by adding the ending **-lud**, e.g. a frog ([żaba](https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%BBaba_wodna)) with legs and hands and behaving like a human - żabo**lud** or also you can use the ending **-człek**, then żabo**człek** or another example of "human + elephant ([słoń](https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%C5%82oniowate))" - słonio**lud**/słonio**człek** (There is a very popular word in Polish - "ufolud" and the diminutive of this word - ["ufo**ludek**"](https://sjp.pwn.pl/slowniki/ufoludek.html) and it means "alien"). I will add, finally, that if we want to define a person who eats (she or he or it has a lot of this food in diet) something, for example watermelons ([arbuzy - Citrullus vulgaris](https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbuz_zwyczajny)), then we can add the ending **-jad** and then such a person will be called arubozo**jad** or with sufiks **-żerca**, then "arbuzo**żerca**" or jabłko**jad**/jabłko**żerca** (apple-eating creature). Creatures with a plant-based diet = roślino**żercy** and those with a diet in which there is meat = mięso**żercy**, then for example, "dinozaury roślino**żerne**" (herbivorous dinosaurs) and dinozaury mięso**żerne** (carnivorous dinosaurs). So you can say in joke that vegetarians and vegans are: "roślino**żerni**/roślino**żercami**".

- [6obcy](https://6obcy.org)  - Website for talking to strangers from different regions of Poland and abroad. You can meet many interesting people here, but you can also find a lot of "suspicious people", so be careful. (M - mężczyzna - male, K - kobieta - female, so at the beginning of the conversation, when someone writes "K", it means that she says she is a woman, it's a pattern that often occurs, or e.g. M20 = a man who is 20 years old, for some people it's just something like a dating chat).
- [Nonsensopedia](https://nonsa.pl/wiki/Strona_g%C5%82%C3%B3wna) - A parody of Wikipedia in Polish and as the name itself says, it is full of nonsense (The equivalent of English [Uncyclopedia](https://simple.uncyc.org/wiki/Main_Page)). Sometimes you can find really funny articles (So stupid |applause for the creativity of their authors| then it could make you laugh) here, especially in those areas that we are very interested in and familiar with. There is certainly a lot of 'difficult humour' here, so it is rather for people with a specific sense of humour.
